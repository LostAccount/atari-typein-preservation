# Atari Type-In Archive

Welcome! This is a community project to preserve type-in programs from Atari 8-bit books and magazines. The goal is to make these programs runnable again and easy to access.

## How it Works

- Each program comes from a printed source like a magazine or book.
- Contributors can pick a program, type it in, test it in an emulator, and fix any errors.
- Once a program works, itâ€™s added to the repository along with a link in the table below.
- We keep track of the original author whenever possible.

## Program Table

This table provides an example of how type-in programs are tracked, their sources, and contribution status. The source columns indicate where the OCRed content can be found. There can be multiple sources: an Archive.org identifier, a direct link, or any other link.
