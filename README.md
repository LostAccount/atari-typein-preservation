# Atari Type-In Archive

Welcome! This is a community project to preserve type-in programs from Atari 8-bit books and magazines. The goal is to make these programs runnable again and easy to access.

## A quick note before you dive in

Thanks for stopping by! This project is still in its early days. I recently came across two other sites that already host some Atari type-in content, and Iâ€™d like to bring that material together here before opening things up further. In the meantime, things may look a bit sparse. I really appreciate your patience while I prepare a more complete starting point.


## How it Works

1. Each program starts from a printed source such as a magazine or book.  
2. A contributor selects a program to work on.  
3. The program is typed in (or errors from an OCR version are corrected).  
4. The program is tested in an emulator or on a real Atari 8-bit computer.  
5. Once it runs correctly, the program is added to the repository along with a link in the table below.  


## Program Table

This table provides an example of how type-in programs are tracked, their sources, and contribution status. The source columns indicate where the OCRed content can be found. There can be multiple sources: an Archive.org identifier, a direct link, or any other link.  

| Program Name   | Source (Book/Magazine)      | Page(s)| Status       | Contributor  | Original Author           | Archive.org Identifier          | Other Link                       | File Link          |

## How to Contribute

1. Pick a program from the table marked **Not Started**.
2. Copy it from an OCRed source (like [archive.org](https://archive.org)).
3. Type it into an emulator and make sure it works.
4. Upload the working file to the repo.
5. Update the table with your status and file link.
