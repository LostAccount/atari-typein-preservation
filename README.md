# Atari Type-In Archive

Welcome! This is mostly a private project to preserve Atari 8-bit type-in programs from books and magazines.  

Right now, the focus is on collecting, testing, and organizing material in one place. Things may look sparse, since Iâ€™m still pulling resources together.  

At some point I may share more openly, but for now this is mainly for my own use and reference.
